v2.0 (05/07/2016)
-----------------

This is the first public release, as an open source project (BSD
licensed).  MPDAF is also now compatible with Python 3.3+.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Image.resample <mpdaf.obj.Image.resample>`: now applies by default an
  anti-aliasing filter when asked to lower the resolution of an image.
  The variance is now computed for the re-sampled image.

* `Image.regrid <mpdaf.obj.Image.regrid>`: **new method** similar to
  `Image.resample`, but more flexible in the positioning of the sky
  in the re-sampled image, and it accepts signed pixel increments.
  `resample` now uses `regrid` and was conserved for compatibility reasons.

* `Image.rotate <mpdaf.obj.Image.rotate>`: now works correctly on images
  whose pixels have different angular sizes along the X and Y axes.

* `Image.align_with_image <mpdaf.obj.Image.align_with_image>`:
  **new method** to resample the image of the object to give it the same
  orientation, position, resolution and size as another image.

* `Image.estimate_coordinate_offset <mpdaf.obj.Image.estimate_coordinate_offset>`:
  **new method** which uses a full-image auto-correlation to measure the
  average offsets between the world coordinates of common astronomical
  features in two images. This was written primarily to determine coordinate
  offsets between MUSE images and HST reference images.

* `Image.adjust_coordinates <mpdaf.obj.Image.adjust_coordinates>`:
  **new method** which determines the world coordinate offsets between an
  image and a reference image, then applies this shift to the reference
  pixel index of the image.

* `Image.mask_region <mpdaf.obj.Image.mask_region>` and
  `Cube.mask_region <mpdaf.obj.Cube.mask_region>` methods have been revised
  to support rectangular and square regions that are rotated.

* `Cube.mask_polygon <mpdaf.obj.Cube.mask_polygon>`: **new method** similar
  to `Image.mask_polygon <mpdaf.obj.Image.mask_polygon>`.

* `Cube.bandpass_image <mpdaf.obj.Cube.bandpass_image>`: **new method**
  for creating images with a given filter response curve.

* `WCS.get_axis_increments <mpdaf.obj.WCS.get_axis_increments>`:
  **new method** which returns the displacements on the sky per pixel
  increment along the Y and X axes.
  There is also a new method `WCS.set_axis_increments <mpdaf.obj.WCS.set_axis_increments>`
  to update the signed displacements on the sky.

* `~mpdaf.MUSE.FieldsMap`: **new class** which reads the possible FIELDMAP
  extension of the MUSE data cube.

* `~mpdaf.MUSE.FSF`: **new class** which proposes a simple FSF model
  (Moffat function with a FWHM which varies linearly with the wavelength).


Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Remove unused methods:

   - Remove the peak detection on a spectrum (``peak_detection``).
   - Remove interactive plotting methods of Spectrum and Image classes.
   - Remove filter methods on images (``minimum_filter``, ``maximum_filter``,
     ``median_filter``) and spectra (``median_filter``).
   - Remove ``Image.add_poisson_noise``.
   - Remove ``Image.sum``.
   - Remove methods to create images (``mask_image``, ``composite_image``, ``make_image``).
   - Remove ``PixTable.get_slices``.
   - Remove the SEA script (each step remains available as library).

* Remove the `drs.calibobj` module.

* Remove submodules *ZAP* and *GALPAK*.

  - `ZAP <https://github.com/ktsoto/zap>`_ is now publicly available.

  - `GALPAK <http://galpak.irap.omp.eu/downloads.html>`_ is also publicly
    available.

* The `resize` methods of Cube, Image and Spectrum have been renamed
  `crop` to better indicate their purpose. The new methods are also faster
  and use less memory, and return the list of slices that have been used to
  crop the data.

* The `rebin_median` methods of Cube, Image and Spectrum have been removed
  because its effect on the variances couldn't be computed, and because it
  didn't seem scientifically useful.

* The `rebin_factor` and `rebin_mean` methods of Cube, Image and Spectrum
  have been replace by the `rebin` method. This method has been simplified
  to make it more maintainable. The simplification to this function was to
  effectively truncate the input data to be an integer multiple of the
  re-binning reduction factor, rather than computing partially sampled
  output pixels for the edge of the re-binned data.

* The method `Cube.get_lambda` has been renamed `~mpdaf.obj.Cube.select_lambda`.

* The method `Spectrum.get_lambda` has been renamed `~mpdaf.obj.Spectrum.subspec`.

* The weighting options of `Cube.sum <mpdaf.obj.Cube.sum>` has been reimplemented.
  The old method with the flux conservation has been moved in the SEA library.

* `WCS.get_rot` has been corrected to always return the angle between north
  and the Y axis of the image, in the sense of a rotation of north eastwards
  of Y.  The updated versions of `Image.get_rot <mpdaf.obj.Image.get_rot>`
  and `Image.rotate <mpdaf.obj.Image.rotate>` resolve this discrepancy,
  so any software that has been using these functions may see changes.

* The return value of the `get_range` methods of Cube, Image and DataArray
  have been changed to a flat array, rather than an array of two coordinate
  tuples that only denoted image corners for non-rotated images.

* `WCS.get_naxis1` and `WCS.get_naxis2` have been removed, because the
  underlying `WCS.naxis1` and `WCS.naxis2` values can be queried directly.

* `WCS.resample` and `WCS.rotate` methods has been removed, because
  they are no more needed by the equivalent methods in `Image`.

* The method `Image.add` has been removed because it is easy for a user
  to do the equivalent by using align_with_image() followed by a simple
  addition of two images.

* PIL dependency has been removed: now MPDAF doesn't read .PNG, .JPEG or
  .BMP images.

WCS
~~~

* When an `~mpdaf.obj.WCS` object is initialized via its cdelt1, cdelt2
  and rot parameters, the corresponding coordinate transformation matrix
  is now calculated in the way recommended in equation 189
  of FITS paper *II*
  (Calabretta, M. R. & Greisen, E. W. 2002 paper II, A&A, 395, 1077-1122).

* The `~mpdaf.obj.WCS` initializer now accepts a `cd` argument, which may
  be used to set the coordinate transformation directly.

* `~mpdaf.obj.WCS.set_step` now changes the pixel scaling correctly for all
  FITS files. The previous version, which worked for MUSE FITS files,
  failed on FITS files whose coordinate transform matrix included any shear
  terms.

* A couple of issues have been resolved in `~mpdaf.obj.WCS.get_step`.
  Incorrect values were returned for FITS files with pixels that were
  rectangular on the sky, rather than square. This didn't affect typical
  MUSE FITS files.

* Don't write WCS headers with both `CDELT1` and `CD1_1`.

Data classes (Cube, Image, Spectrum)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Methods which transform the object return now by default another object.
  The optional copy argument can be used to request that the input data be
  transformed in-place.

* Fix `clone` to update the NAXIS keywords in the data header

* Change management of the data type (by default Cube object have the type of the DATA extension)

* The variance calculation of `~mpdaf.obj.DataArray.sqrt` has been
  corrected.

* Fix `Cube.median <mpdaf.obj.Cube.median>` when used with `axis=None`.

* `Cube.get_image <mpdaf.obj.Cube.get_image>`: add input parameters in the
  FITS header.

* Allow one to overwrite `BUNIT` for data without unit.

* Fix `EXPTIME` of combined cubes when cubes overlap (using a median of the
  exposure map give a more realistic estimate).

* The `mean` method of Cube, Image and Spectrum have been rewrote to
  optionally perform weighted means.

* In the `sum` methods of Cube, Image and Spectrum, the weighted mean of
  the spectral pixels was being multiplied by the total number of input
  pixels instead of the number of unmasked pixels. This will have resulted
  in sums that were too small wherever there were masked spectral pixels.

* Propagate mask in `Cube.subcube <mpdaf.obj.Cube.subcube>`.

* Refactor `Cube.subcube_circle_aperture <mpdaf.obj.Cube.subcube_circle_aperture>`
  to use `Cube.subcube` and `Cube.mask`.

* Make `Cube.subcube <mpdaf.obj.Cube.subcube>` and
  `Image.subimage <mpdaf.obj.Image.subimage>` as similar as possible.
  These methods extract rectangular as well as square areas, and they now
  work correctly for data with rectangular pixels.

* A couple of problems have been fixed in the code that multiplies an
  image by a spectrum. The original code didn't handle variances
  correctly and crashed due to a non-existent variable.

* Correct the pixel value shown when moving the mouse over pixels of
  `Image.plot <mpdaf.obj.Image.plot>`.

Sources
~~~~~~~

* Correct bug in `Catalog.from_sources <mpdaf.sdetect.Catalog.from_sources>`

* Rewrite `Catalog.match <mpdaf.sdetect.Catalog.match>` which was not working
  properly, now it returns a dictionary.

* Tell which keyword is missing when creating a source.

* Allow one to deactivate the masking of invalid values when loading a source.
  This part (`~mpdaf.sdetect.Catalog.masked_invalid`) takes ~40% of the
  total load time for sources with a lot of tables and columns.

Muselet
~~~~~~~

* Optimize `matchlines` function

* Split the main function in several functions

* Remove Numpy warning

* Use a Numpy array and not a masked array for the weights array

* Use masked median of inv_variance

* Make Muselet less verbose when running SExtractor

Pixtable
~~~~~~~~

* Convert pixtable values to double to avoid precision errors.  This avoids
  discrepancies between `_get_pos_sky` and `_get_pos_sky_numexpr` (Numexpr
  seems to use double precision by default) and probably also with other
  methods.

* Fix initial value for `~mpdaf.drs.PixTable.subtract_slice_median` correction.
  This value was set to 1 which seems wrong for an additive correction. To
  emphasize the fact that some combination of slices and quadrants are not
  valid, and allow one to filter these values later, this commit changes the init
  value for the count to -1, and the correction to NaN.

* Fix `~mpdaf.drs.PixTable.select_sky` in the case of positioned pixel table.

RawFile
~~~~~~~

* Simplify `~mpdaf.drs.RawFile` and `~mpdaf.drs.Channel` classes


v1.2 (13/01/2016)
-----------------

* Optimize ``Cube.subcube`` and use ``__getitem__`` in ``subcube``/``subimage``
  and other methods to speed up things (avoid reading the full cube/image).
* Add missing units in image methods.
* Fill data with NaNs only for float arrays, otherwise raise exception.
* Use a new ``MpdafUnitsWarning`` to allow filtering the unit warnings. It can
  be used this way::

      # filter only MPDAF's warnings
      from mpdaf.tools import MpdafUnitsWarning
      warnings.simplefilter('ignore', category=MpdafUnitsWarning)

      # or filter both MPDAF and Astropy warnings
      import astropy.units as u
      warnings.simplefilter('ignore', category=u.UnitsWarning)

* CUNIT FITS keyword: patch to read ``mum`` as micron.
* Correct ``cube.get_step`` that returned nothing.
* Use setuptools for the ``setup.py``:

  - Allow one to use develop mode (``python setup.py develop``).
  - Install dependencies automatically.
  - Use optional dependencies.

* Remove unmaintained submodules: *quickViz* and *fsf*. *quickViz* is still
  available `here <http://lsiit-miv.u-strasbg.fr/paseo/cubevisualization.php>`_
  but maybe not compatible with the latest Aladin version.
* Remove the ``displaypixtable`` module.
* Avoid a huge memory peak when creating masked arrays with ``mask=True``.
* Add some tools to print execution times.
* Added scaling option in ``Cubelist.combine()``.
* Fix ``cube.var = None`` to remove the variance part of the Cube.
* Revert ZAP version to the same as before 1.2b1 (was updated by mistake).
* Add a new method ``Image.find_wcs_offsets`` to find the WCS offset with a
  reference image.

PixTable
~~~~~~~~

* Use ``CRVAL1/CRVAL2`` instead of ``RA/DEC`` as reference point for positioned
  pixtables.
* Remove ``cos(delta)`` correction for positioned pixtables.
* Use directly the binary mask in ``extract_from_mask``.
* Allow one to use a boolean mask for pixtable selections.

Sources
~~~~~~~

* ``Source.add_image``: the order of the rotation is set to 0 in case of an
  image of 0 and 1.
* Add methods to manage a history in the sources headers.
* Use ``savemask='none'`` for MASK and SEG extensions.
* Correct bug in ``source.write`` when a column has no unit.
* Allow one to pass the lambda range and wave unit to ``Source.extract_spectra``.
* Correct bug in Catalog initialization due to units.
* ``Catalog.from_sources``: update the default format.
* Split ``Source.add_masks`` in 3 methods: ``find_sky_mask``,
  ``find_union_mask`` and ``find_intersection_mask``.
* Isolate comments and history in source information.

Muselet
~~~~~~~

* Limit the memory usage.
* Added option to clean detections on skylines.
* Added exposure map cube.
* Remove automatic narrow-band images cleaning in muselet.

v1.2b1 (05/11/2015)
-------------------

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add a new base class for the :class:`~mpdaf.obj.Cube`,
  :class:`~mpdaf.obj.Image` and :class:`~mpdaf.obj.Spectrum` classes.  This
  allows one to fix some inconsistencies between these classes and to bring more
  easily new common features.

* FITS files are now read only when the data is needed: when creating an object
  the data is not loaded into memory. The data is loaded at the first access of
  the ``.data`` attribute, and the same goes for the variance (and ``.var``).
  A consequence of these optimization is that the ``CubeDisk`` class has
  been removed.

* Shape of objects:

  - Remove the ``shape`` parameter in constructors. Instead the shape is derived
    from the datasets.
  - Spectrum's shape is now a tuple, which is consistent with the Cube and Image
    classes, and with Numpy arrays.

* Allow one to specify the data type of Cube/Image/Spectrum in the constructor (and
  read an extension as an integer array).

* Change the behavior of the ``.clone`` method: now by default it returns an
  object with the data attribute set to None. This was changed as an
  optimization, because in most cases (at least in MPDAF's code) a Numpy array
  is set to the cloned object, just after the clone, so the Numpy array that was
  created by clone was discarded. You can get the previous behavior with::

    sp = sptot.clone(data_init=np.zeros)

  Or you can set directly a Numpy array to the cloned object::

    sp = sptot.clone()
    sp.data = np.zeros(sptot.shape)

* The ``fscale`` attribute of a Cube/Image/Spectrum object has disappeared.
  MUSE units are now read from the FITS header (it takes into account possible
  ``FSCALE`` keyword). The ``.unit`` attribute of Cube/Image/Spectrum saves
  physical units of the data values and the scale value as an ``astropy.units``
  object.

* When a method of MPDAF objects requires a physical value as input, the unit of
  this value is also given ``(x=, x_unit=)``. By default coordinates are in
  degrees and wavelengths are in angstroms.

* Results of ``Source.subcube`` methods are always centered on the source given
  in input (columns/row of NaN are added when the source is on the border).

* Source/Catalog object write and read masked values.

* From Johan and Benjamin: shell script to interact in Topcat between the
  muselet catalog and a MUSE datacube opened in ds9.

Changes that should be imperceptible to users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use ``astropy.wcs`` for handling the wavelength coordinates.
* Simplify logging configuration.
* Cube/Image/Spectrum constructors: allow one to pass a hdulist object in place of
  the filename (this option should reduce the time when the FITS file is used
  several times because of the big time spent reading the FITS headers).

v1.1.18.1 (31/07/2015)
----------------------

* Full correction of ``mask_polygon`` function.

  - Add needed keywords: RA, DEC, MJD-OBS, DATE-OBS, PI-COI, OBSERVER, OBJECT,
    ESO INS DROT POSANG, ESO INS MODE
  - Allow one to override OBJECT name
  - Compute a correct EXPTIME for the mosaic case
  - Put the list of merged files in comments, otherwise the keyword value can be
    too long for MuseWise
